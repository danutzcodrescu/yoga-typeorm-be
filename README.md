# Awesome Project Build with TypeORM and GraphqlYoga

Demo backend project using [TypeORM](http://typeorm.io/#/) as ORM and [GraphqlYoga](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-yoga) as API.

CI and CD is done using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) by running tests and deployment to a private docker repo hosted on AWS ECR. The deployment to ECR is done using a personal deployment [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/danutzcodrescu/circle-ci-docker/). Code coverage is ensured by [Codecov](https://codecov.io), while automatic dependency update is done is using [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/).

## PS: It is my personal playground for different things that I find interesting
